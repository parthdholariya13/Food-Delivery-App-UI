## ‚ú® Features

The prototype encompasses a complete user journey for a secure chat app, including:

*   **Real-time Messaging:** One-on-one and group chats with a modern, clean interface.
*   **Secure Communication:** **End-to-End Message Encryption (E2EE)** to ensure user privacy.
*   **Multi-Modal Calls:** High-quality **voice and video call** functionality integrated seamlessly into the chat interface.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** UI flows for setting up enhanced security options:
    *   **PIN Code Security**
    *   **Fingerprint Recognition**
    *   **Face Recognition**
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Designed to provide a consistent experience across **iOS, Android, and Web** devices. Access your chats anywhere, on any device.
*   **Conversation Management:** Intuitive screens for viewing, managing, and navigating chat conversations.

## üé® Design & Prototype

This project was built using an iterative design process:
1.  **Wireframing:** Initial layout and user flow sketches.
2.  **High-Fidelity Mockups:** Pixel-perfect visual designs for all screens and states.
3.  **Interactive Prototyping:** Creation of a dynamic prototype in Figma to simulate the final application experience, including:
    *   Micro-interactions (e.g., sending a message, toggling settings).
    *   Navigational flows (e.g., moving from the chat list to a conversation to a video call).
    *   Authentication process simulation.

### üõ†Ô∏è Built With
